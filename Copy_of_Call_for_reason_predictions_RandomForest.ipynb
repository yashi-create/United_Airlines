How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a huge problem with my upcoming flight. Ugh, this is so frustrating!\\n\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Can you please provide your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\\n\\nCustomer: *provides confirmation number* It's flight 3849 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Thursday. So basically, I booked this flight months ago for a really important work meeting. But now your stupid website is saying the flight is overbooked! What the hell am I supposed to do now?!\\n\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, overbooked flights are never ideal. Let me take a look here...umm, it looks like you are correct, this flight is currently oversold. Not the news I'm sure you wanted to hear. Let me see what options I can provide to help get you to your meeting. *typing sounds* It looks like I can offer you a seat on a later departure that same day, at 5:30pm instead of the original 11am time. I'll waive the change fee since this is due to the oversale. Or I can try to get you on another airline, but it would mean going through a different airport than planned. Does either of those work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? Neither of those work - the meeting is at 10am so both those flights would have me missing it completely. This is unacceptable! Why wasn't I contacted about this sooner? Now what am I supposed to do, my whole trip is screwed!\\n\\nAgent: You're right, missing your meeting is not ideal. Let me check a few other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights for that day are oversold as well. I can try putting you on standby for the original flight in hopes that someone doesn't show, but there's no guarantee. As for not contacting you sooner, oversales sometimes happen last minute as passengers cancel or change plans. I apologize for the lack of notice. The best I can offer is a full refund for your ticket since we can't get you there as booked. I'll also provide a $200 travel voucher for the inconvenience.\\n\\nCustomer: A refund and $200 voucher isn't going to get me to my meeting! I need to be on that flight or one that same day. This is going to cost me my job if I miss this, ugh I can't believe this. \\n\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a critical business meeting because of an airline issue is unacceptable. Umm, let me check one other long shot option...it looks like I may be able to book you on a same-day red-eye on another carrier, flying out of a different airport about an hour away. It would involve renting a car and driving like crazy to make the flight, but you would land in LA around 6am, giving you time to make your 10am meeting. I know it's not ideal, but would that work in a pinch? I can get you booked on that alternate flight right now if you want to go that route.\\n\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess that's my only choice at this point. Yeah, go ahead and book me, I'll figure out the ride and driving. This is ridiculous. Your airline better compensate me for this huge hassle.\\n\\nAgent: I completely agree, you should not have to deal with all this trouble. Let me get you booked on that flight right now. I'm also going to credit $500 to your account for future travel due to the major inconvenience. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do as you work to make that alternate flight. And again, I sincerely apologize for the trouble. Getting customers where they need to be is the most important thing.\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Fine, I guess $500 is better than nothing. Thanks for at least getting me on another flight I suppose. This better not happen again!\\n\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything we can to avoid an situation like this in the future. Thank you for your patience and for being understanding - I know multiple flight changes is never ideal. Please feel free to reach back out if any other issues come up. Safe travels and I hope your meeting goes well despite the changes!\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone angrily*\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for your call. *hangs up*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, this is Steve speaking. How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next month. Umm, I wanted to ask about changing one of the stops on the return journey.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'd be happy to take a look at your booking and see what options we have for changing that stop. What would you like to change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah right, so currently I have a stop scheduled in Paris on the way back from London. But something's come up and I need to get back a day earlier. So I was wondering if there's a flight that stops in Amsterdam instead that would get me back a day sooner?\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation and see what flights we have. *types on keyboard, taps mouse* Hmm, it looks like the only flight with availability that stops in Amsterdam a day earlier leaves London at 6am. Would that work with your schedule change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah not really, 6am is just too early for me. Any other options maybe with a later departure from London but still an earlier arrival back in Chicago than my current Paris stop flight? This is really important to me.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the time change is important. Just one second while I take a closer look...*more typing* It looks like there is a flight that stops in Frankfurt that departs London at 9:30am and would still get you back to Chicago a day earlier than your scheduled Paris flight. Would routing through Frankfurt work instead of Amsterdam?\\n\\nCustomer: Frankfurt could work, yeah. What would be the cost to change it to that flight? I'm hoping it won't be too much more since this change is kind of last minute.\\n\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference...*keyboard typing* Okay, because this is a routing change within two weeks of departure, there would be a $150 change fee plus the difference in fare. The Frankfurt flight is about $100 more than what you already paid for the Paris routing. So the total to change would be $150 + $100 for $250. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm, that's a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance we could waive the change fee since this is sort of an emergency on my part? I've been a United customer for years and this is really first time I've needed to change a flight.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, flight changes can definitely throw a wrench in plans. Let me take a look at your loyalty account really quickly...*typing* You're right, it looks like you've been a loyal customer flying with us for 10 years, with no other changes or cancellations on your record. I think in this case we can make an exception and waive the change fee. The difference in fare would still apply, so the total to change to the Frankfurt flight would just be $100. Does that work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, that's much more doable. Thank you so much for your help and for waiving the fee, I really appreciate it. Okay, let's go ahead and change it to the Frankfurt flight then. You've saved my trip!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you on that earlier flight. One moment while I process the change for you...okay, all set! Your new itinerary is confirmed with the stop in Frankfurt. Thank you for flying United and safe travels!\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks again! Have a good one.\\n\\nAgent: You too, take care!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sam. How can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling to inquire about changing the dates of my upcoming flight from New York to LA. My flight is this Friday but something has come up and I need to travel a few days later instead. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. What's the name the ticket is booked under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's booked for John Smith.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look at our flight options for later dates. Umm, it looks like we have seats available on Sunday and Monday. Would one of those days work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, those dates would work. What would the cost be to change it to one of those days? I'm hoping it won't be too much more than what I already paid. \\n\\nAgent: *typing noises* Just one second while I check the fare difference... Alright, it looks like we can change you to the Sunday flight and the additional charge would only be $50 more than your original ticket. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: You know, that's actually not too bad. I was expecting a much bigger change fee. Sunday will work then, go ahead and switch me over to that flight.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that fit your schedule and budget. Just give me a moment here to process the change...okay, all set! You're now booked on the Sunday flight from New York to LA. The additional $50 will be charged to the credit card we have on file. Thank you for being so flexible on your dates - I'm sure this will make your travel plans a little less stressful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sam. I really appreciate you getting me switched over to the new flight.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could work something out. Safe travels and enjoy your trip.
